# 🏨 Securing Big Data in the Hospitality Sector – Research Project

## 📘 Project Overview

Big Data refers to the massive volumes of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data collected by organizations. These data are utilized for predictive modeling, advanced analytics, customer service enhancement, personalized marketing, and streamlining operations and use gantt chart template . However, as the use of big data increases, so do the associated cybersecurity risks—especially in sectors like hospitality.

This research-based project aims to **analyze security risks** associated with big data in hospitality and provide **strategic recommendations** to protect customer data and ensure business continuity.

## 🧪 Methodology

1. **Literature Review**
   - Reviewed current studies on big data in hospitality.
   - Studied incidents of data breaches in hotel chains.

2. **Risk Assessment**
   - Identified risks such as:
     - Data breaches and ransomware
     - Insider threats
     - Poorly configured cloud storage
     - Lack of encryption for customer data

3. **Company Analysis**
   -
   - Technologies used: Mobile app, online booking system, customer feedback analytics.

4. **Recommendations**
   - Encrypt sensitive customer data at rest and in transit
   - Conduct regular vulnerability assessments
   - Train staff on cybersecurity hygiene
   - Monitor real-time analytics using a system
